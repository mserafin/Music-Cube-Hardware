# Music-Cube-Hardware
Software for Arduino microcontroller. The Music-Cube changes the defined playlists in the Spotify music service.

Spotify can be installed on any device, but must share one common user account.
From among many connected devices, the first active device is selected and actions are performed on it.
Three gestures have been programmed:
- Play - when the rfid card is placed on the device
- Stop - at the moment of removing the rfid penalty from the device
- Skip - at the moment of quick removal and application of the same card on the device
